# Community Interactive Convention


### Section One: Purpose of the Convention

1. The "Community Interactive Convention" &#40;hereinafter referred to as "this Convention"&#41; aims to promote a supportive, cooperative, friendly, welcoming, and cosmopolitan community. It aims to maintain a community of friendly and inclusive members, ensure a peaceful and caring communication environment, and allow community members to interact joyfully, peacefully, and without harm.

2. This Convention is committed to integrating all those who love life, uphold integrity, and are friendly and kind. Together with all community members, we strive to build a joyful and memorable community of hobby. We aim to create a warm, harmonious, loving, wonderful, and diverse community, establishing one with distinct themes and genuine content. We encourage content that is loving, interesting, and useful to thrive within the community.

3. The communication environment of a community is jointly influenced by the community's management team and its members. The impact of the latter often expands rapidly with the growth of the community's membership. Malicious, indecent, inappropriate, and unethical behavior by certain community members may cause significant harm to the communication environment. Sometimes, these harms may not receive sufficient attention from the community's management team, and the consequences will be borne collectively by all community members, and even the entire community. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the individual qualities of community members, it is also necessary to promote the entire community to optimize the existing communication environment to higher standards, so as to jointly maintain a positive community communication environment.

4. This Covenant, following the community's own direction of evolution, actively guides and assists the community management team in managing the community. It aims to reduce malicious, indecent, inappropriate, and unethical speech and behavior, and improve the communication environment of the community through more effective management mechanisms.
